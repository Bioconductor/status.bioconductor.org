2024-02-22-10-16-25 (Auto-detected) Bioconductor Archive Down

The Bioconductor Core team has noticed at around 10:30 AM ET on Feb 22, that the Bioconductor archive, notably affecting installation of packages from old releases, is selectively inaccessible. We believe this might be affected by the nationwide outage reported the same morning, as connections from certain data centers seem to be affected, while the archive remains accessible on some home networks. If the issues persist, the Bioconductor Team might redirect the URLs for old releases to a backup location until the connectivity issues as resolved.
